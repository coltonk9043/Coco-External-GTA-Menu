# Coco External GTA Mod Menu
> DISCLAIMER: This program is purely for Educational and Evaluation purposes ONLY. Be aware that I am not responsible for any damage caused by misuse. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! 

Started as a personal project to attempt externally modifying games, I decided to release this mod menu on here to help anyone else who has an interest in game modding.
I am aware that many other menus will easily outperform this menu. If you are looking for a well-versed menu, this is not the place to be! My recommendation would be to check out Kiddion's Modest External Menu instead.

As this menu matures, I plan to add many more features. Any help along the way would be appreciated! :)

This menu is fully external and does not depend on any natives or game dependencies. Be aware this does not prevent bans!

# How to download and run?
1. Download the menu.
2. Start GTA5 and wait until you have fully loaded ingame.
3. Start the Mod menu.
4. Use the default keybinds (Listed Below) to navigate the menu!

# Default Keybinds
[Numpad 0] - Hide / Show the menu.
[Numpad 8] - Navigate UP the menu.
[Numpad 5] - Navigate DOWN the menu.

# FAQ
**Why is my Anti-Virus blocking the download / preventing this from running?**
This Menu constantly monitors for keypresses and modifys the memory of another process. Anti-Viruses often flag programs like these because they operate similarly to Malware. This menu is fully open source and can be reviewed by anyone for malicious code.
**Will this work online?**
Yes, the menu will work online. Responsibility for any damage will not be held by me.
**Numpad keys will not work. I can't navigate the menu**
This menu requires you to enable NumLock on your keyboard.
